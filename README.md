# micons â€¢ an icon theme for vscode

## Why make micons?

In short, icons communicate information faster than looking at file extenstion and serve as a reference when looking through nested directories (and they look cool).

### Why not use ____ icon theme?

Other icon themes I've tried have had poor support for both light/dark mode editor themes. Some icons would look great on a dark UI but indistinguishable on a light UI (or vice-versa).

## Current list file extenstion with custom icons:

- Folder/Directory (open)
- Folder/Directory (closed)
- .vscode folder (open)
- .vscode folder (closed)
- C (.c)
- C++ (.cpp)
- C/C++ header (.h)
- GO (.go)
- HTML (.html)
- SCSS (.scss)
- CSS (.css)
- Lua (.lua)
- Markdown (.md)
- TOML (.toml)
- Python (.py)
- Rust (.rs)
- Swift (.swift)
- Typescript (.ts)
- React.ts (.tsx)
- React.js (.jsx)
- .git & .gitignore

*all other files without defined custom icon default to .js icon (see below)*.

Icons that are hard to see either on light or dark background should have a variant that is easier to see.
