# Exa Icons â€¢ an icon pack for vscode

**Why an icon pack?**

Icons communicate information faster than looking at file extenstion and serve as a reference when looking through nested directories (and they look cool).

**Why not ___ icon pack?**

Other icon packs I've tried have had poor support for both light/dark mode editor themes. Some icons would look great on a dark UI but indistinguishable on a light UI (or vice-versa).

**Current list file extenstion with custom icons:**

- Folder/Directory (open)
- Folder/Directory (closed)
- .vscode folder (open)
- .vscode folder (closed)
- C (.*c)
- C++ (*.cpp)
- C/C++ header (*.h)
- OpenCL (*.cl)
- GO (*.go)
- HTML (*.html)
- SCSS (*.scss)
- CSS (*.css)
- Lua (*.lua)
- Markdown (*.md)
- TOML (*.toml)
- Python (*.py)
- Rust (*.rs)
- Swift (*.swift)
- Javascript (*.js)
- Typescript (*.ts)
- React.ts (*.tsx)
- React.js (*.jsx)
- .git & .gitignore
- *.lock
- LICENSE

*all other files without defined custom icon default to .js icon*.

Icons that are hard to see either on light or dark background should have a variant that is easier to see.
